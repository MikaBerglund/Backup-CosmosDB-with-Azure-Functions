Deploying the Backup Application
================================

There are many ways you can use to deploy the backup application to Azure. The easiest is probably to just deploy it directly from Visual Studio using the Publish functionality.

If this is something you're not familiar with, then I recommend you to have a look at [this article](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/benjaminperkins/2018/04/05/deploy-an-azure-function-created-from-visual-studio/).

Configuration
-------------

Before deploying though, you should make sure you have the right configuration. There are just a few things you need to configure. The configuration is described in detail on [this page](configuration.md).
